Radio over Free Space Optics (RoFSO) is a communication technology that combines the advantages of both radio and optical communication. It uses free space optics (FSO) technology to transmit data using light waves, and radio frequency (RF) technology to provide a backup communication channel in case of FSO link failure due to atmospheric turbulence or other environmental factors.

RoFSO has the potential to provide high-speed, secure, and reliable communication links for various applications such as broadband internet, disaster management, military communications, and more. However, RoFSO performance can be affected by various environmental factors, including atmospheric turbulence, fog, and rain, which can cause signal attenuation and degradation.


Machine learning (ML) techniques can be used to improve RoFSO performance by predicting and mitigating the effects of environmental factors on the communication link. ML algorithms can be trained to analyze the data collected from various sensors and sources, including weather forecasts, and predict the probability of link failure. Based on these predictions, the ML algorithm can optimize the RoFSO parameters such as the modulation format, transmit power, and link bandwidth to improve link reliability and throughput.

Moreover, ML can also be used to develop intelligent routing algorithms that can dynamically switch between RoFSO and RF links based on environmental conditions. By utilizing the strengths of both communication technologies, ML-based RoFSO systems can provide a reliable and high-speed communication link with low latency and high bandwidth for various applications.
